 I fell by the wayside like everyone else<br>
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself<br>
Our every moment, I start to replace<br>
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say<br><br>

When you hurt under the surface<br>
Like troubled water running cold<br>
Well, time can heal, but this won't<br><br>

So, before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?<br>
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather<br>
So, before you go<br>
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?<br>
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless<br>
So, before you go<br><br>

Was never the right time, whenever you called<br>
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all<br>
Our every moment, I start to replay<br>
But all</td>
