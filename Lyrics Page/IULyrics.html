So are you happy now?<br>
Finally happy now, are you?<br>
Well, I'm exactly the same<br>
I think I've lost everything<br>
Everything comes as it pleases and leaves without a goodbye<br>
Like this, I don't want to love anything<br>
Where the sun has set, as far as the sun sets<br>
I travel in those memories<br><br>

Under an orange sun<br>
We dance with no shadows<br>
There is no such thing as decided farewells<br>
Meet me in that memory that was once beautiful<br>
Forever young<br><br>

Island, yeah, here is an island<br>
A small one that we made with each other<br>
Yeah, um, forever young, the word "forever" is a sandcastle<br>
A farewell is like a disaster cast<br>
A morning greeted along with yearning<br>
Let us both pass this eternity<br>
Surely meet once more on this island<br><br>

Like what someone said as they were consoling me, passing<br>
It isn't that easy to forget a memory merely big as a handspan<br>
Even as time goes by, still<br>
At that place which takes hold of me<br>

We lie down atop of each other<br>
Share stories that aren't of sorrow<br>
There is no such thing as gloomy endings<br>
I will forever meet you in this memory<br>
Forever young<br><br>
