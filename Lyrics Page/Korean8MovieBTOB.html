At first it's like that<br>
Too bad for me to be by your side<br>
No matter how you tell me, you're just like this<br>
All I have to do is enjoy the whole night, Hey DJ<br><br>

Women should be careful when they wake up<br>
You won't be able to have it in two man<br>
Fire, fire, watch out in the dark streets<br>
Even if you try to seduce me, I belong to my lady<br>
A piece of humorous cake<br>
Other modifiers other than the best pass<br>
Make history or not<br>
I'm standing towards you all night alright<br><br>

I'm a little dizzy, hold me down<br>
My heart is warm, I can't lie well<br>
Actually, I think I'm very lonely, listen<br>
Please don't leave me baby<br><br>

Love is like a movie, everyone is obvious<br>
I want to love you too<br>
Always new<br>
You can have everything<br>
My time flows to you<br><br>

Accept me before it's late<br>
Anything that hurts your heart (anything that hurts)<br>
I'll be your man<br>
To be my last love<br><br>

Before it's too late girl you better stop fronting<br>
I'm one in a million, limited edition<br>
No kidding you'll be wishing you could be my Mrs.<br>
Sooner or later girl, you'll want that position<br>
When I walk up in the club, all the girls stare at me<br>
I'm the only thing they see and the guys wish they were me<br>
'Cause I'm fresh and clean from my head to my feet<br>
I'm the definition of the word masterpiece<br><br>

You got me excited<br>
I feel weird and floating<br>
Even if I just talk, my ears tickle<br>
Who planted a dangerous dynamite like you in me<br>
The eve of the storm just before the explosion<br>
The bursting heart and the bursting heart are bomb bombs<br>
The obvious ending is bye bye like the princess and prince of the love revolution<br><br>

How far will the two of us meet?<br>
I will never make the same mistake again.<br>
Move your body right now, don't leave me<br>
Do it again, do it again, do it again, yeah<br><br>
