Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles<br>
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble<br>
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines<br>
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)<br>
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch<br>
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?<br>
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings<br>
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)<br><br>

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy<br>
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'<br>
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it<br>
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)<br><br>

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it<br>
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it<br>
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it<br>
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)<br><br>

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."<br>
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches<br>
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches<br>
Think retail therapy my new addiction<br>
Whoever said money can't solve your problems<br>
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em<br>
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"<br>
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms<br><br>

My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')<br>
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)<br>
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)<br>
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah<br><br>

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers<br>
If it ain't money, then wrong number<br>
Black card is my business card<br>
The way it be settin' the tone for me<br>
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah<br>
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah<br>
Shoot, go from the store to the booth<br>
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot<br>
Never mind, I got the juice<br>
Nothing but net when we shoot<br>
Look at my neck, look at my jet<br>
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect<br>
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set<br>
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah<br><br>
