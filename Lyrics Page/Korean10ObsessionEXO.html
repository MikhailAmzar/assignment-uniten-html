Please stop it now<br><br>

As the night makes me blind<br>
You snuck in again<br>
You lick around my ears while I'm asleep, stare<br>
Then you scratch and laugh<br>
Your voice whispers endlessly<br>
Oh you're the bad dream kill<br>
You keep possessing and calling me<br>
To come where you are<br>
Yes, to come to you<br><br>

You say you know me? (I don't think so)<br>
Who are you to snuggle in? (I don't think so)<br>
You cover my eyes (I don't think so)<br>
You cover up the truths (I don't think so)<br>
Let go of the empty dreams (I don't think so)<br>
Don't make me spit out the poison (I don't think so)<br>
You'll never have me again (I don't think so)<br>
Shut up and go away<br><br>

Thousand nights<br>
I repeated so many times<br>
A vicious cycle of nightmares<br>
I'll end it now<br>
The turned-off exit light<br>
Get away from me now<br><br>

I'm sick of it<br>
Ha! It's enough<br>
All the gibberish on my ear<br>
Imma let it blow<br>
My five senses are focused on it, on edge<br>
You come in and stir it up recklessly<br>
When I fall asleep with one eye open<br>
You permeate without a sound, the phantom<br>
I'm so sick and tired of it<br>
When the light turns on, I hope you're gone<br><br>

You say it's for me? (I don't think so)<br>
Who are you to snuggle in? (I don't think so)<br>
Permeating deeply (I don't think so)<br>
I'm confused (I don't think so)<br>
Take wherever (I don't think so)<br>
Don't even be seen (I don't think so)<br>
You'll never have me again (I don't think so)<br>
Stop your obssesion<br><br>

Thousand nights<br>
I repeated so many times<br>
A vicious cycle of nightmares<br>
I'll end it now<br>
The turned-off exit light<br>
Get away from me now<br><br>

Blacken my heart<br>
Creepin' dark night<br>
Stainin' my soul<br>
When I open my eyes like yet I'm still asleep<br>
The sudden goosebumps and its clear traces<br>
And the names on the ground that are owned by no one<br>
Call out, dance tonight<br>
Say what you like<br><br>

The time we were happy together,I know<br>
I have to end them now<br>
Forget everything, yeah<br><br>

You say you know me? (I don't think so)<br>
Who are you to snuggle in? (I don't think so)<br>
You cover my eyes (I don't think so)<br>
You cover up the truths (I don't think so)<br>
Let go of the empty dreams (I don't think so)<br>
Don't make me spit out the poison (I don't think so)<br>
You'll never have me again (I don't think so)<br>
Shut up and go away<br><br>

Thousand nights<br>
I repeated so many times<br>
A vicious cycle of nightmares<br>
I'll end it now<br>
The turned-off exit light<br>
Get away from me now<br>
One night, what I saw in the darkness<br>
Was the strange shadow that chased me after<br>
The turned-on exit light<br>
It's me looking at myself in the mirror<br>

Get away from me<br>
Disappear<br><br>
