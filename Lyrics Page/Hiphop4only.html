Yeah, does anybody feel like me?<br>
Show of hands, I don't need a lot, I just wanna find my peace<br>
Yeah, why you throwin’ rocks, oh, you wanna kill my dreams?<br>
Okay, tell me everything I'm not<br>
You think I didn't know those things?<br>
Always been a little lost and I still might be<br>
Life's hard, but it's okay (It's okay)<br>
Watchin' the comments feels like I'm at a court date<br>
How could I complain<br>
With a house like this and a car like that in the driveway?<br>
Half of what I say<br>
Kinda feels like a dream that I’m gonna wake from someday<br>
Wishin’ that I'd pray<br>
A little more often and put more time into my faith<br>
Travel in my brain, woo, might find damage and no grace<br>
Things that I hold on to, but I won’t say things that I won't let go<br>
So I chain my soul to the heartbreak<br>
Havin' a nice day, that's not a average in my case<br>
Don’t like cameras in my face; glamour, it's all fake<br>
Love my job, but it might seem odd that I'm here 'cause I hate fame (Oh)<br>
Yeah, pain might get to me, throwin' threats at me<br>
They can't tell, disconnectin' me, it's affectin' me<br>
Hide that well, they'll write checks to me, but don't check on me<br>
Find myself, always questioning what comes next for me<br>
I can't be the only—<br><br>

No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight<br>
No, I can't be the only—<br><br>

Yeah, if you made a list of people that you trusted would you put your name down?<br>
Do you know who you are when you look at life and you talk about yours, do you feel proud? (Lonely)<br>
Are you leaving a mark, or scared to make a bad impression so you just go hide in the dark? (Lonely)<br>
Livin' and playin' a part, knowin' regret'll come back up tomorrow<br>
That's what it does, ain't it? Don't know what we're chasin', but we all do it<br>
Just a part of life, I guess we're all foolish<br>
Running after what we think will make us happy 'til it falls through (Lonely)<br>
And then we find out later it ain't what we wanted<br>
So we give up on it, then we pile the garbage (Lonely)<br>
And we watch it grow and find a drug to numb it<br>
'Til we hit the point that we can barely function<br>
Am I motivated? Is my music dated?<br>
Would I be the same if I was medicated?<br>
Even therapists say I need medication<br>
I avoid it, though, because I'm scared to take it<br>
Am I the only one that has a loaded gun<br>
That's full of doubts and memories to overcome?<br>
And I complain about 'em when they shoot at me<br>
But I know truthfully I like to load 'em up and let 'em—<br>
That's so sad to see, that's so sad to see, I need help<br>
They talk passively, then come after me by myself<br>
Lost that half of me, God, there has to be someone else<br>
Don't feel bad for me, I just can't believe that I'm the only<br><br>

There's gotta be somebody out there<br>
There's gotta be somebody somewhere<br>
Who needs company, and it's comforting to know, know (Know)<br>
There's gotta be somebody out there<br>
There's gotta be somebody somewhere<br>
Who needs company, and it's comforting to know<br><br>
