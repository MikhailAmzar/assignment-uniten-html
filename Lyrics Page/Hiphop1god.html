I just want to make this clear (Listen)<br>
I am a believer<br>
But sometimes it gets hard (Listen)<br>
My name is Dax (Dear God)<br><br>

Dear God<br>
There’s a lot of questions that I have about the past (Can you hear me?)<br>
And I don’t want hear it from a human you made it so you’re the last person that I’m ever gonna ask<br>
Tell me what’s real, tell me what’s fake<br>
Why is everything about you a debate? (Why?)<br>
What’s the point of love?<br>
Every time I’ve showed it I was broken and it’s forced me just to only wanna hate<br>
Why’s there only one you but multiple religions? (Why?)<br>
Why does every conversation end in a division? (Why?)<br>
Why does everybody want to tell us how to live but they won’t listen to the same damn message that they giving? (Fuck them!)<br>
Tell me how to feel, tell me what’s wrong<br>
I tried to call, pick up the phone (Pick up!)<br>
I’m on my own<br>
Everybody says you’re coming back, then man why the hell's it taking so long?<br>
Why do I hurt? (Why?)<br>
Why is there pain?<br>
Why does everything good always have to change? (Why!)<br>
Why does everybody try to profit off another man's work then destroy it just for monetary gain?<br>
Tell me are you black or are you white?<br>
I don’t even really care I just really want to know what’s right (I don't care)<br>
They been saying one thing but I’ve been looking in the book<br>
And it seems like they’ve been lying for my whole damn life<br>
Tell me where I’m going (Where?)<br>
Is it heaven or hell?<br>
I just hope this message greets you well<br>
I had a dream that I was walking with the devil<br>
Don’t remember how it feels but I swear that I remember the smell<br>
Looked me right into my eyes and told me everything I wanted could be mine if I gave up and decided to sell<br>
But I said I’d rather die then get mine now I’m here no fear one man with a story to tell<br><br>

Dear God<br>
Where were you when I needed it?<br>
When I fucked up and repeated it?<br>
When they set the bar and I exceeded it? (Where were you??)<br>
My life is like a book that they’ve been judging by a cover but have never took the time to fucking read the shit (Fuck!)<br>
I remember telling you my goals and my dreams but you didn’t even answer so I guess you didn’t believe in it<br>
I remember sitting with a gun to my head trying to ask you for some help but I guess you didn’t believe in it!<br>
I don’t want religion I need that spirituality<br>
I don’t want a church I need people to call a family<br>
I don’t wanna tell my sins to another sinner just because he’s got a robe and he went to some academy<br>
I don't wanna read it in a book, I wanna hear it from you<br>
Don’t wanna learn it in my school because they’re hiding the truth (Swear..)<br>
Don’t wanna talk about it to another fucking human being and that's only reason that I even stepped in this booth<br><br>

Dear God<br>
How do I take this darkness and turn it into light? (Talk to me)<br>
How do believe in a concept where I speak to a man I’ve never seen with my own two eyes? (How?)<br>
How do I know that religion wasn’t made just to separate the world and create a whole disguise <br>
Just to keep us in these chains while the rich get richer and the poor pray to you and perpetuate a lie?<br>
How do I know this ain't some big joke? (How?)<br>
How can I have faith when there is no hope?<br>
How the hell does one man have 100 billion dollars and we still have people on the street that are broke?<br>
There's a lot of things I wanna talk about and get off my chest<br>
I can’t sleep 'cause the devil won’t let me rest<br>
I used to know a fucking pastor in a church and I can still hear the screams of the kids he would fucking molest<br><br>

Dear God<br>
Do you hear me? (Do you hear me??)<br>
I’m supposed to fear you but you ain’t said shit so maybe it's you who actually fears me?<br>
I don’t know the answer I just want to see it clearly<br>
So many lies there’s a 1000 different theories<br>
All I want to know is who really made religion because I know it wasn’t you but don’t nobody believes me<br>
No more lies, no more death<br>
Bring back King, bring back X<br>
Please dear God let their souls rest<br>
Protect who’s left and watch their steps<br>
Dear God (Dear god)<br>
I don’t want to have to ask you again<br>
I just hope that you know that I’m still a believer so I’ll end this all by saying amen
It's Dax<br><br>
