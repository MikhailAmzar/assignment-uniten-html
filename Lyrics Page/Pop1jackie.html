I think you got the wrong impression 'bout me, baby ('Bout me, baby)<br>
Just 'cause they heard what hood Iâ€™m from they think I'm crazy (They think I'm crazy)<br>
Okay, well maybe just a little crazy (Just a little)<br>
'Cause I admit I'm crazy 'bout that lady, yeah (Oh)<br>
Finger to the world, it's fuck you, pay me (I been slavin')<br>
Run the pussy 'cause I'm runnin' out of patience<br>

You should not be alone, oh, oh<br>
All this drink got me throwed, oh, oh<br>
Club got me right<br>
And I feel so alive (Ayy)<br>
She don't want a thing<br>
She don't wanna be no wife (Ayy)<br>
She just wanna stay all night<br>
She just wanna sniff the white (Ayy)<br>
Can't tell her nothing, no<br>
Can't tell her nothing, no<br><br>
