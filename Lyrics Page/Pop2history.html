We got history (history)<br>
Got me feeling the nostalgia<br>
When you look at me (look at me)<br>
Thinking 'bout what could've happened<br>
Or what could've been<br>
Finally a face I know, ain't that a sight to see?<br>
Take my time then take your clothes off<br>
One more time, maybe<br>
Actin' like you don't recall, it ain't impressin' me<br>
Didn't come to see your friends, I know you came for me<br>
Like your dress, but you fit better in my wrinkled tee<br>
We moved on to newer things, but we got history<br><br>

Put my feelings all aside<br>
Don't know how to make it right<br>
Pictures poppin' on my mind<br>
All these occasions<br>
Let's work it out with me<br>
I don't think it hurts to give another try on it<br>
Ain't nobody here know you like I do<br>
Ask all your friends if they know 'bout your size of shoes<br>
How you like to cry when you laugh, when you off the booze<br>
I moved on but I still remember a thing or two<br>
I know you said "gimme a hug," and I said "gimme a break"<br>
I wasn't trying my best, all the mistakes that I made<br>
I'm learning that it ain't the right move<br>
Learned from my mistakes, ain't that what the adults do?<br><br>

Ayy, ayy, yuh<br>
Bet you got nobody 'round to make your day better<br>
Sun brighter, don't got too much time, so girl, let's fuck now<br>
And talk later, put your pride aside and let me in<br>
You know I got better since<br>
You so good at self control, but maybe now it's time for change<br>
I've been alone for so long, got the one<br>
Didn't realize good ones exist in the world 'til I lost one<br>
Eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind<br>
Things I would give to feel your lips for the last time<br>
Go and hang with your friends, I'll put this bullshit to end<br>
I rained on your parade and I just wish you the best<br>
I think it's time for me to bounce soon<br>
I just wish I had someone to say "I'm home" to<br><br>
