I was distracted and in traffic<br>
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened<br>
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?<br>
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?<br>
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how<br>
How to let you go and let communication die out<br><br>

I know, you know, we know you weren't<br>
Down for forever and it's fine<br>
I know, you know, we know we weren't<br>
Meant for each other and it's fine<br><br>

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br>
You'd come over and you'd stay the night<br>
Would you love me for the hell of it?<br>
All our fears would be irrelevant<br>
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br>
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight<br>
And there wouldn't be a reason why<br>
We would even have to say goodbye<br>
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?<br>
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?<br><br>

I tried to imagine your reaction<br>
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened<br>
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'<br>
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen<br>
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how<br>
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out<br><br>

Hmm<br>
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?<br><br>
