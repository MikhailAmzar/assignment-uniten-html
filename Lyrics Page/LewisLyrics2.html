I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me<br>
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy<br>
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know<br>
Somebody to have, somebody to hold<br>
It's easy to say, but it's never the same<br>
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain<br><br>

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall<br>
And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br>
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br><br>

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to<br>
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you<br>
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal<br>
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels<br>
It's easy to say, but it's never the same<br>
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape<br><br>

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes<br>
I fall into your arms<br>
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around<br><br>

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall<br>
And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br>
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br>
But now the day bleeds into nightfall<br>
And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br>
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br>
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br>
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br><br>
