Small talk, no conversation<br>
That look makes me impatient<br>
I can't tell what you're thinking<br>
Please, tell me what you're thinking<br>
Last night, we were more than fine<br>
Just tell me if you changed your mind<br>
If you changed your mind (Mind)<br><br>

'Cause I'm all, I'm all in<br>
I'm calling, no answer<br>
Would you text me when you feel like?<br>
When it feels right to you<br>
But I'm all, I'm all in<br>
I'm falling faster<br>
But if you're looking at me with a heart of doubt<br><br>

Don't kiss me right now<br>
Don't tell me that you need me<br>
Don't show up at my house<br>
All caught up in your feelings<br>
Don't run me 'round and 'round<br>
Don't build me up just to let me down<br>
Just to let me down, down, down (Hey)<br>
Don't mess with my head<br>
Don't tell me you're falling<br>
With your feet still on the ledge<br>
I'm all out of breath<br>
Baby, don't run me 'round and 'round<br>
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me right now<br>
On your lips, just leave it<br>
If you don't mean it<br><br>

Oh, yeah<br>
You know you got me in the palm of your hand<br>
But I love those hands<br>
Oh, yeah<br>
But you only let me hold you when he can't<br>
Yeah, I don't understand<br><br>

Hurry home, let's never leave the house (But you don't mean it)<br>
Let's stay in bed while all our friends go out (But you don't mean it)<br>
Why you let those words come out of your mouth? (If you don't mean it)<br>
You've been staring at me with a heart of doubt (Ah)<br><br>
