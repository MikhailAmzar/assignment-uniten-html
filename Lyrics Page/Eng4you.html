I wish I could unsay the words I said<br>
I wish I could un-see the videos in my head<br>
And if I could untie the knot and un-hear the promises that you forgot<br>
Would I do that? Would I?<br>
I wish I could un-kiss your dirty mouth<br>
I wish I could un-bite the peach and just spit it out<br>
Oh, if I could undo the shame of ignoring my friends who told me you're insane<br>
Would I do that? Would I?<br><br>

Unloving you, is the hardest thing to do<br>
Wish I could find a way to be un-love with you<br>
Unloving you, you're all I wanna lose<br>
But every night I'm closer to the bitter truth<br>
I just can't un-love you<br>
Maybe I can't un-love you<br><br>

I wish I could un-feel your skin<br>
I wish I could un-drown these feelings and learn to swim<br>
Oh, if I could unlock the gate and un-light the fire that you put in me<br>
Would I do that? Would I?<br><br>

Falling, I can't help myself I keep on falling<br>

Unloving you, is the hardest thing to do<br>
Wish I could find a way to be un-love with you<br>
Unloving you, you're all I wanna lose<br>
But every night I'm closer to the bitter truth<br>
I just can't un-love you<br>
I just can't un-love you<br><br>
