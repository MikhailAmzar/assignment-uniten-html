Ice water, turned Atlantic (Freeze)<br>
Nightcrawlin' in the Phantom (Skrrt, Skrrt)<br>
Told them hoes that don't you panic<br>
Took an island, (Yeah) flood the mansion (Big water)<br>
Dropped the roof, more expansion<br>
Drive a coupe you can stand in (It's lit)<br>
See the bitches undercover (In the sheets)<br>
I'm an ass and titty lover (Big ass)<br>
Guess we all made for each other<br>
Now that all the dawgs free (Yeah, yeah)<br>
And we out in these streets (Alright)<br>
Can you do it, can you pop it for me?<br><br>

Pull up in a Demon, on God (On God)<br>
Lookin' like I still do fraud (Fraud)<br>
Flyin' private jet with the rod (Rod)<br>
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (This that Z shit)<br>
Pull up in a Demon, on God (On God)<br>
Lookin' like I still do fraud (Fraud)<br>
Flyin' private jet with the rod (Rod)<br>
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (This that Z shit)<br><br>

Blow the brains out the coupe (Boom)<br>
Police wanna talk, but I'm on mute (Woo-woo, hey)<br>
I'ma bust her wrist down 'cause she cute (Ice, ice)<br>
Fuck her on a yacht, dive in a pool (Yeah)<br>
She an addict (Addict), addict for the lifestyle and the Patek (Patek)<br>
Big daddy, have you ever felt Chanel fabrics? (Chanel)<br>
I be drippin' to death, I need a casket (Drippin')<br>
And we got more stripes than the ref, he foul, TEC him (Bow, stripes)<br>
In the middle of the field like David Beckham (Field, bow-bow)<br>
All my niggas locked up, for real, I'm tryna help 'em (Free, free)<br>
When I got a mil', got me the chills, don't know what happened (Hoo, chills)<br>
Pop pills, do what you feel, I'm on that zombie (Hey, hoo)<br>
I'm more like Gaddafi, I'm not no Gandhi (Gaddafi, hey)<br>
I'm more like I'm David, Goliath runnin' (Hey, hey)<br>
Niggas be clonin', I find it funny (Clone, haha)<br>
We from the Nawf, straight out of the dungeon (We from the Nawf, hey)<br>
I go in her mouth, she can't tell me nothin' (Eghck, eghck, egchk)<br>
300, the watch is out of your budget (Woo, woo, 300)<br>
Mean-muggin' got me clutchin'<br>
Yeah, and this stick right out of Russia<br><br>

In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser<br>
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor<br>
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart<br>
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start<br>
I got the fire on me in BET Awards<br>
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it<br>
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'<br>
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'<br>
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage<br>
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas<br>
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'<br>
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance<br>
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks<br>
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk<br>
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock<br>
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw<br>
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean<br>
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine<br>
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean<br>
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme<br><br>
