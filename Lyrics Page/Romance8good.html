Lyin' isn't better than silence<br>
Floatin', but I feel like I'm dyin'<br><br>

Still, no matter where I go<br>
At the end of every road<br>
You were good to me<br>
You were good to me, yeah<br>
I know it's easier to run<br>
After everything I've done<br>
You were good to me<br>
You were good to me<br><br>

(Let's get this bread, son)<br>
You were good to me<br>
(Whatever you want)<br>
(Hit me with that again)<br>
You were good to me<br><br>

Leavin' isn't better than tryin'<br>
Growin', but I'm just growin' tired<br><br>

Now I'm worried for my soul<br>
And I'm still scared of growin' old<br>
You were good to me<br>
You were good to me, yeah<br>
And I'm so used to lettin' go<br>
But I don't wanna be alone<br>
You were good to me<br>
You were good to me, yeah, oh<br><br>

God only knows where our fears go<br>
Hearts I've broke, now my tears flow<br>
You'll see that I'm sorry<br>
'Cause you were good to me<br>
You were good to me<br><br>

And now I'm closin' every door<br>
'Cause I'm sick of wantin' more<br>
You were good to me<br>
You were good to me, yeah<br>
Swear I'm different than before<br>
I won't hurt you anymore<br>
'Cause you were good to me<br><br>
