Why is everyone so down?<br>
What's the problem, say something<br>
It’s so icy here<br>
Is this the trend these days?<br>
Why is everyone so boring?<br>
Actually, I guess I'm the same<br>
Tell me what I got to do<br>
Hurry and turn on the bluetooth<br><br>

Just put any song on<br>
Anything fun<br>
Just dance however you want<br>
As if you're just fine<br>
Don’t wanna think about anything<br>
I just wanna live for a moment<br>
I'm sick and tired of my everyday<br>
Keep it up, one more song<br><br>

Just put any song on<br>
Who cares, it's so boring<br>
I think we need to refresh<br>
From our built up stress<br>
I wanna laugh till my belly button falls off today<br>
What up my dawgs, where are you<br>
Come over with some beer and chips, huh<br><br>

Don't really feel like clubbing<br>
So come over to my house<br>
Block any outsiders<br>
Not enough time to even talk all night<br>
Some are struggling, some are partying<br>
I feel so sentimental, I want my youth back<br>
It was so noisy and then one by one<br>
They all leave<br><br>

If you can't leave<br>
Don’t even look out the window<br>
Even if you get drunk and make a mess<br>
No worries at all<br>
Who cares about your image, we're all friends here<br><br>

Let's get in our last spurt before it's too late<br>
Not a lot of time left in our twenties<br>
Change into comfy clothes<br>
You look nice<br>
Get’em high<br>
From far away, this'll look like a comedy<br>
You've never been to such a wholesome party like this, right?<br>
A lot of feelings going on at 2am<br>
Drinks mixed with emotions into a whirlwind<br><br>

Just put on any<br>
Just put on any song<br>
Just put on any song<br>
Just put on any song<br>
Just put on any song KOZ<br><br>
