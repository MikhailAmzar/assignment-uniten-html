I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day<br>
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?<br><br>

I think I missed you callin' on the other line<br>
I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind<br>
Talkin' love but I can't even read the signs<br>
I would sell my soul for a bit more time<br>
You stain all on my body like you're red wine<br>
You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline<br>
You run your middle finger up and down my spine<br>
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize<br>
I'm so fuckin' sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry<br>
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody<br>
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick<br>
And now I'm sick, throwing fits<br>
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fuckin' day since I left<br>
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head<br>
And I'm down and depressed<br>
All I want is your head on my chest<br>
Touchin' feet in my bed<br><br>


I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day<br>
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?<br>
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day<br>
You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?<br><br>

Tell me what you need<br>
I can make you more than what you are<br>
Come and lay the roses on the floor<br>
Every single Sunday, don't get bored<br>
I just want to freeze<br>
I can give you more than what you are<br>
Now I see you standing all alone<br>
I never thought the world would turn to stone<br><br>

So call me stupid, call me sad<br>
You're the best I've ever had<br>
You're the worst I've ever had<br>
And that keeps fuckin' with my head<br>
Call me stupid, call me sad<br>
You're the best I've ever had<br>
You're the worst I've ever had<br>
And that keeps fuckin' with my head<br><br>

So call me stupid, call me sad<br>
You're the best I've ever had<br>
You're the worst I've ever had<br>
And that keeps fuckin' with my head<br><br>

You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day<br>
So why aren't you here?<br>
Why aren't you here?<br>
Why aren't you here?<br>
Why aren't you here?<br>
Why aren't you here?<br><br>
