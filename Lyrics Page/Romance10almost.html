I'd like to say we gave it a try<br>
I'd like to blame it all on life<br>
Maybe we just weren't right<br>
But that's a lie, that's a lie<br><br>

And we can deny it as much as we want<br>
But in time our feelings will show<br>
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up<br>
The truth is, everyone knows<br><br>

Almost, almost is never enough<br>
So close to being in love<br>
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you<br>
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart<br>
But right here in each others arms<br>
And we almost, we almost knew what love was<br>
But almost is never enough<br><br>

If I could change the world overnight<br>
There'd be no such thing as goodbye<br>
You'd be standing right where you were<br>
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh<br><br>

Try to deny it as much as you want<br>
But in time our feelings will show<br>
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up<br>
The truth is everyone knows<br><br>

Huh-huh, baby<br>
You know, you know, baby<br>
Almost, is never enough, baby<br>
You know, hey<br>
And we can deny it as much as we want<br>
But in time our feelings will show<br>
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up<br>
The truth is, everyone knows<br><br>

Huh-huh, baby (Almost)<br>
You know, you know, baby<br>
Almost, is never enough, baby<br>
You know, hey<br><br>
