Strangely, these days I just like things that are easy<br>
Nonetheless, I still like Corinne's music<br>
Rather than hot pink, I prefer dark purple<br>
What else was there, pajamas with buttons and lipstick<br>
Nonsensical jokes<br><br>

I like it, I’m twenty five<br>
I know that you like me<br>
I got this, I'm truly fine<br>
I think I know myself a little bit now<br><br>

Rather than long hair, I definitely prefer a short bob<br>
Nonetheless, I was still pretty when I sang Good Day<br>
Why is it that I like things that are a bit tacky?<br>
Rather than pictures, I prefer filled palettes, diaries, times I was asleep<br><br>

Everything's hard because we're young<br>
I'm sick of getting nagged all the time<br>
A shabby child who always got scolded
Barely passed my 20s<br>
The happiness only lasted for a while, oh my<br>
Why do they say that it hurts because we're young<br>
Hey Ji-Eun, Oppa just turned 30<br>
I'm really not, but I suddenly became an adult<br>
Even though I still have a long way to go<br>
I'm only five years older than you<br>
Past twenty, not yet thirty, in between, right there<br>
When I'm not a kid or an adult, when I’m just me<br>
I shine the brightest<br>
So don’t get scared when the darkness comes<br>
Because it's so beautiful, because flowers bloom<br>
You are a child that will always be loved<br><br>

Palette, diaries, times I was asleep<br>
I like it, I’m twenty five<br>
I know that you like me<br>
I got this, I'm truly fine<br>
I think I know myself a little bit now<br>
(Still have a lot to say)<br>
I like it, I'm twenty five<br>
I know that you hate me<br>
I got this, I'm truly fine<br>
I think I know myself a little bit now<br><br>
